= Proposed standards for content publishing using RVN BC and IPFS =

==Abstract==

Use standardized json descriptor files to allow 3rd parties to properly parse data sets published to IPFS.  Please review 
[https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki Mangofarmassets RIP 11 ~ RIP 14] before continuing. 

==Motivation==

By having a standard format by which content creators can publish content it will allow any 3rd party to properly display and market said content.  

==Methodology==

Using the methodology out lined in [https://github.com/MangoFarmAssets/rips/blob/master/rip-0011.mediawiki Mangofarmassets RIP 11 ~ RIP 14] 
anyone is able to post digital content to IPFS and share that content using RVN asset transactions.  This content data set may contain multiple 
files and descriptors, both encrypted and readable.  Depending on the type of content being published to IPFS the follow “types” of json files are proposed:
