1st draft

Right at the end of last century a good friend of Eddie Van Halen said to me that Eddie once told him that he made $1.25 an album sale.

Back in 2013 Thom Yorke, the lead singer of Radiohead, took an actively combative stance towards Spotify in an interview with the Mexican 
culture site Sopitas saying: “We can build the shit ourselves, so fuck off. But because they’re using old music, because they’re using 
the majors… the majors are all over it because they see a way of re-selling all their old stuff for free, make a fortune, and not die.”

Yorke’s comments critiqued Spotify but also put blame at the feet of major labels for continuing a century old tradition of repackaging 
and selling music. He balanced a classic 20th century skepticism towards the major label system – to quote Q-Tip back with A Tribe Called 
Quest “Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty; Record company people are shady” – with an updated 21st century bone to pick with 
the digital companies profiting off as outsiders to the industry. He saw that the streaming first model wasn’t actually hurting labels, 
but rather the artists was seeing even more money escape their pockets.

A year later Taylor Swift wrote in the Wall Street Journal to champion the album format.  She recognized the shift from the album towards 
the future proposed by Spotify, as one that would directly be to her disadvantage. Swift directed a few choice words at record labels writing 
“I hope they don’t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.”

And these are giants of the industry.  Everything is dominated by the large labels and corporations. If you can’t sell 100,000 copies then 
the market is closed to you.  There are thousands of musicians and bands scratching out a living, playing local clubs and small circuits.  
If they happen to get a break then the lion share of any profits are quickly extorted away, sign here or get nothing.  To quote the Rolling 
Stones “What’s a poor boy supposed to do?”  10% of $1 million is better than 100% of noting, or is it.   How many hundreds of millions of 
dollars have been made by one hit wonders only years later to find the artist working for an hourly wage.

When Thom Yorke said “We can build the shit ourselves” little did he know that the technology needed to do just that had been released in 
open source just a few years earlier.   Currently under development is an online marketplace where any musician, writer, producer, artist 
ect... can sign up and offer their creations directly to the public.  A level playing field, where all content providers have the same access 
to the global market.  Where sellers take the majority of the gross profit and payouts are instant.  A consumer purchases a copy of your 
song and you have your money within minutes of the transaction.  

The DTM is global and exists in a distributed form in a “cloud” supported by the content providers and the consumers who use it.  As long as 
the Internet exists the market and content will exist.   Once content is posted for sale no more human interaction is needed, the entire process 
is automated using Block Chain technology.  No place to hack or cheat the system.  The entire economic system is administer by a not for profit 
foundation and funded by a portion of the revenues.

Sounds great so what next?

Typical sign up for a content provider is $$$ USD.  During our run up to launch we are signing up the first 100 content providers with content 
ready to go online for free.   You also get your Unique ID token that identifies you to the system.  Only the holder of your token can post your 
content and your token can only be held by your wallet.  No one can steal your token or your identity on the Marketplace.   We have built in to 
the revenue model room for an “Agent” or customer service.  This is typically the person who signed you up and will help get your content on to the 
Marketplace.  Some Agents take care of all the technical stuff, leaving the artist free to create.  Some artists want more control and handle 
all their own postings.  How you want to handle and market your content is up to you.  

We have also created a set of tools you can use to help promote your content.  Simple web sites allow you to upload your content along with pictures, 
descriptions, information, tags and samples.  If you are a live performer you can print up a set of codes for fliers to give out at your gigs.  
These are individual codes that encourage consumers to join the marketplace and purchase your content.

In order you be a content provider you will have to also complete the simple Know Your Customer process.  KYC is the same thing that banks and other 
financial institutions do so that they know who they are dealing with.  If you are going to sell something on the Marketplace or take payment this 
is a necessary step.

So why should I join?

1.	Low cost to entry
2.	Have a much or as little control as you wish over your content
3.	You are paid directly and quickly on every sale
4.	Retain the majority of gross sales
5.	No label or marketing company needed unless you want one
6.	Global marketplace for a much larger audience
7.	Everything is administered by a not for profit foundation so there are no share holders to pay
8.	No large corporations to extort every dollar away from the artists 
9.	To support an open and honest global Marketplace that gives all creators the same access to sell their creations
10.	To help change the world for the better

So how can you do this?

First off we are a not for profit foundation.  The only money collected is for maintaining, improving and promoting the Marketplace, all other 
money goes to the creators and their agents.  The Block Chain technology allows us to build a system that will run virtually by it self.  In other 
words once the system is up and running there is not a lot of cost to keep it going, this allows for the creators to keep the majority of the 
revenues.  Block Chain is a revolutionary technology that keeps an unbreakable ledger of all transactions.  This means no one can cheat the system.

Let’s use some analogies

As a content provider you have a store in a gated community where you offer you creations for sale.  This gated community is the encrypted network 
and you must have special keys from the Gatekeeper to put your items up for sale.  Now whenever you add another item to your store you will lock it 
with a new key and a location in your store.  So the for sale items will have a location, an individual key and a key to get into the gated community.  

Now shoppers get a key to the gated community so that they can shop.  They can’t add items but they can see and sample whatever the shop keepers put 
on the shelves.  Now if the shopper buys something the Gatekeeper give them a copy of the individual key and the location of the item.  Now only the 
shopper who bought the item can use the key.  If they give the key away to someone else the key will not work.  Even if someone figured out how to 
copy the key and got the location of the item they would still have to have a key to the gated community. 

A little background on the technical stuff

A really smart guy by the name of Phil Zimmermann created something known as Pretty Good Privacy or PGP. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy .  
In a nutshell I or anyone can create a Public Key and a Private Key.  If I give someone else a copy of my public key that person can scramble a message, 
song, book or any file with my public key and send me a copy of the scrambled file.  Only the private key can unscramble the file. To take this a step 
further, through the use of Block Chain technology we can tie the public and private key to an “address”.  Only one unique “address”, on only one device, 
can exist at one time.  We send a special token, with the PGP keys, that are tied to the “address”.  If that token is not in that “address” the files 
cannot be unscrambled.  So when a shopper purchases keys to the content they want, the Gatekeeper sends them a copy that can only be used by that shopper.  
The shopper can’t copy or sell the keys.  This is the exact same thing as walking into a music store and buying a CD or album.  Only you have that copy, 
but in this case you can’t transfer ownership or give away a copy of that CD and the creator gets paid as soon as you pay.

Okay so what did I actually buy?

As a consumer when you make a purchase, a file, with the location and the key to unlock the file you bought, is created.  This file is encrypted using 
the consumer’s public PGP key and posted to same network that is used to store content for sale.  Then a token is sent to the consumers address with the 
link to the encrypted file that contains the key and location of the content purchased.  This guarantees that only the purchaser, or a designated gift 
address, can unlock the content.  So now I can unlock the file what can I do with it.  Well you can stream the music, book, video to your device.  This 
way you can access the file from anywhere you have internet access.  You can download the content to your device for offline use.  Just like making a 
copy of that CD you bought, but remember all content is covered by copy write laws and you are subject to the same civil and criminal penalties.

How safe is my content?

Thanks to Edward Snowden, we're getting a new look at which programs can successfully keep out the NSA. A report in Der Spiegel has shed new light on the 
NSA's encryption-breaking programs, and put a spotlight on the handful of programs that are still giving them trouble.  

“PGP encryption tools and OTR chat encryption also caused major problems for the agency, causing entire messages to disappear from the system, leaving 
only the message: "No decrypt available for this PGP encrypted message."

You may have read a couple of years ago that PGP had a flaw.  This “flaw” pertains to email clients and does not affect the encryption system the 
Marketplace uses.   All your content is safe.

What if I sell the rights to my content?

Initially payment tokens are issued associated with your unique token.  That means anything you post goes to the same holders of your payment tokens.  
Payment tokens can be created for specific content or reissued for the content provider but there is an add cost of 100 RVN.  Payment tokens can be 
sent to any KYC RVN wallet and will receive payment proportional to the share of token held in that address for any sale.  ?% of any payment tokens 
will always be sent to the host or Marketplace.  This is what funds the running and maintaining of the Marketplace

How does this help me with copy right laws

The laws in your jurisdiction are the laws in your jurisdiction.  What the Marketplace can do is create a legally admissible transaction trail of all funds.  
So if someone posted music that the courts later rule that the revenues belonged to someone else, there would be a full ledger of who posted the content 
and all the financial transactions.  In other words, a full record of all transactions for both business and legal purposes can be had at a touch of a button.  

How do I get my money?

As we stated payments are almost instant.  Your payments will be to your wallet on your RPi4 in RVN or RavenCoin.  From there we give you a number of options.  
You can use a service like NowPayments.io to exchange your RVN into any other major crypto currency or fiat currency.  Exchange your RVN for gold or silver.  
There are also several companies that will allow you to load your RVN directly to a credit card for use where ever Visa or MC are accepted

What does the “Agent” do?

Agents sell the marketplace.  They sign up and provide customer service to Content Providers.  Agents typically receive 10% of any sale from any CP that 
they sign up.  This is not a hard rule and the function of the payment tokens on the BC allows payments to be setup in whatever way the “Parties” agree too.  
Some CP will want their Agent to handle all the technical aspects of putting content on the Marketplace.  Some CP will not need much support.  
The Marketplace allows the Agent and the CP to conduct their individual business anyway they wish as long as it does not violate the rules.
